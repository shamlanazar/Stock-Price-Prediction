# Stock-Price-Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using the LSTM neural network and further provides a comprehensive stock analysis through a dashboard built with Plotly Dash. The LSTM model is employed for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time-series predictions.

## Modules Used
- **LSTM Neural Network:** Implemented for stock price prediction.
- **Plotly Dash:** Utilized for building an interactive and visually appealing stock analysis dashboard.
